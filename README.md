#MangalMurthi Distributors – Business Description

MangalMurthi Distributors is a multi-branch jewellery distribution and retail operations business engaged in the sale, movement, and accounting of jewellery items across multiple locations. The business operates with a structured workflow involving barcode-based item tracking, branch-wise stock management, billing, and daily financial monitoring.

To ensure accuracy, compliance, and transparency, the operations are supported by a dedicated ERP system that manages inventory flow, sales billing, cash and expense tracking, and CA-ready financial and GST reporting. The system enables precise item-level traceability, real-time branch reporting, and legally compliant documentation required for audits and taxation.
